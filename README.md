# pixi-ts-parcel-starter

A starter project for 2D web-based game development.

## What we're integrating

- [Pixi.js - HTML5 renderer](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs)
- [Parcel - Web Packager](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (edit + debug)

## Goals

- Can rely on TypeScript without having to drop in JS-land all over the place
- Window resizing is always tricky, so do somehthing simple, but reasoanble
- Must be able to set breakpoints and debug in Visual Studio Code
- Build and serve local builds
- Build release builds that can be deployed as static site
- Work decently on desktop and phone (high DPI doesn't suck)

- [Progress Web App](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter)
  - Remove web chrome (fit right on the screen)
  - Work offline
  - Pin to home screen
